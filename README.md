# Hi, I'm Kelly!

## About Me

I am an Operating Room Nurse with a passion for technology. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at Oregon State University, I am eager to transition my career into the tech industry.

In between classes, I'm working on developing a road trip planning app and constantly adding new features to enhance user experience.
